# Charge-distribution-on-a-conducting-plate

In this project we are simulating a system consisting of a conducting plate with charge distributed on it and a charge at a distance d above the plate. We will be carrying out a set of experiments which include a neutral plate, a plate with a single charge distribution and a system with varying d. The simulation is carried out in python programming language and we will be making use of the Monte Carlo method.
